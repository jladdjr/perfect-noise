Problem statement:

Without a CLI, the user can only use diana-pad as Python library.

* Solution

Add support for a basic CLI that includes support for:
- help
- generating a pad
- encrypting a message
- decrypting a message

* Details

$ dp help

Should print help text, including:

#+begin_quote
<overview of what dp does>
<list of supported commands>
  <syntax>
  <description of command>
#+end_quote

$ dp pad [--path <path>] [--size <bytes>] [--description <desc>]

Defaults:
- path => $CWD/main.pad
- size => 1 MB
- description => (blank)

$ dp encrypt

* No-go
