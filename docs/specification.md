## Pad specification

Perfect Noise can create and maintain a One-time Pad for users.

A Perfect Noise pad is a directory that includes:
- a `metadata` file
- a `blocks` folder containing a set of _block files_

By convention, the name of a pad directory ends in `.pad`.

The `metadata` file contains metadata for the pad and looks something like:

```yaml
- name: "Alice One-time pad"
- description: "One-time pad for corresponding with Bob"
- created: "2024-09-15"
```

The `blocks` folder contains a set of files containing
[cryptographically secure random numbers](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/random-numbers/#random-number-generation).

### Blocks

Each block file has a [uuid](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html)-based filename,
such as `9969a58f-35eb-492d-902b-50d41e78838f`.

Each block file consists of [pseudo-random data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random).
Block files can be different sizes.

## Message Specification

A Perfect Noise Message consists of:
- a `blocks` file
- a `message` file

The `blocks` file contains a list of uuid strings separated by newlines.
The uuids represent the blocks needed to decrypt the message.

The `message` file is a binary file representing the encrypted content.

A message is packaged as a [tar](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html) archive that contains the above files (without any directory structure).

### Message length

The exact message length -- that is, the size of the encrypted message in bytes --
is treated like a secret.

The length of the message is given in the first block of encrypted data.

## Decrypted Message specification

Decrypting a `message` will always return a tar archive.
Packaging the message as an archive allows for metadata about the encrypted file(s)
(such as names, extensions, creation and modification timestamps, ownership, etc)
to be preserved.

The encrypted content could be a simple plaintext file,
but could also be an arbitrary file or collection of files.
