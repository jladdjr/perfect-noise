Refactor pad.py so that it becomes the first (of several) Python
packages that will all live inside the perfect-noise repo.
Use the nested structure described in this article:
https://geekcafe.com/blog/2025/11/multi-project-python-development-the-complete-guide

When configuring the package's metadata and build process,
use Hatch as the build backend. Follow the general build instructions
provided in https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/
but stick with the following directory structure:

perfect-noise       // repo
  pad               // module
    README.md
    LICENSE
    pyproject.toml
    src
      pad.py
    tests
      test_pad.py

All existing tests for pad.py should be adapted to run correctly using
the new structure.

Create a file called cli.py with a `pad` function that serves as an
entry point for invoking pad as a command line utility

The pad project's packaging should list `pad` as an
executable that should be created by pip. See
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/creating-command-line-tools/

A new set of tests should be added to exercise the pad CLI.

The new `pad` cli should support the commands listed in the pad README.
